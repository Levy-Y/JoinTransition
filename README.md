# JoinTransition (C# Port for FiveM)

This is a C# port of the original [JoinTransition](https://github.com/DevTestingPizza/JoinTransition) script, originally written in Lua for FiveM.

> **Note:** I am not affiliated with the original creator. This project was created to preserve and modernize the original functionality by translating it into C#. The original repository has been archived.

## üéÆ What It Does

JoinTransition adds a smooth transition effect between the FiveM loading screen and when the player spawns in-game. This C# version aims to replicate the behavior of the original Lua script, while allowing easier integration into C#-based FiveM resources.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Download, and unzip the latest release into your FiveM server‚Äôs `resources` directory.
2. Ensure your `server.cfg` includes the resource:
```txt
ensure JoinTransition
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Original License & Respect

The original Lua script includes this license notice:

> *"Edit it if you want, but don't re-release this without my permission, and never claim it to be yours!"*  
> ‚Äî Vespura (2018)

This port was created with full respect for that notice. No ownership is claimed. If the original author requests removal or changes, they will be honored immediately.
